Hello!

In this SQL code, I've thoroughly performed data cleansing on a large table containing global layoff data. The primary actions I took include:

- Removing duplicates to ensure data accuracy.

- Standardizing data for consistency across all records.

- Handling missing values by applying appropriate replacements.

- Cleaning unnecessary data to streamline the dataset.

If there are any questions or further clarifications needed,
feel free to reach out to me at my email: fmoreno140802@gmail.com :)
